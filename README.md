# really-sick-dotfiles

my dotfiles set up as [described here](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)

## .vimrc 

based on [an example](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc) with as of yet very minor changes

## Plugins

ctrlp
delimitMate
dracula-theme
nerdtree
syntastic
vim-airline

### ToDo

Add a way to quickly install plugins and vimrc from this repo
Break out vimrc into multiple files
